#Hashes, like arrays, are also collections of data. However, they are not ordered and the information is stored and accessed in pairs called keys and values.

#You can think of an array as an ordered list and an hash as an unordered dictionary. Remember our trivia app? It would probably be a lot easier to just store an answer with a question rather than trying to make sure both arrays are perfectly aligned.

#A hash is initialized with curly brackets, and, like arrays, can be created and populated a few different ways. Letâ€™s jump into IRB and practice.

#my_hash ={}
#my_hash = Hash.new
#my_hash["name"] = "steph"
#my_hash["age"] = 30
#my_hash
#grades = {"Hank" => 80, "Gepetto" => 70}
#grades["Gepetto"]

#grades2 = {Lilliana: 100, Henry: 50}

#~> grades2[:Henry]

#~> lunch = {:location => "Velvet Cactus", :attendees => ["Ryan", "Frank"]}

#~> lunch[:location]

#~> grades3 = grades2.to_a
